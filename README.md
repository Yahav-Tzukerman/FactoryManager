## ⚙️ Installation

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yahav-Tzukerman/Factory-Manager.git
   cd Factory-Manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your MongoDB connection:

- Create a .env file in the root directory.
- Add the following environment variables:

  ```bash
  MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
  APP_ENV=development
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
  PORT=3000
  ```

Adjust as needed for production.

Optional: Configure other settings in /configs/config.js as needed.

## ▶️ Usage

1. Start the server locally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Local app: [http://localhost:3000/login.html](http://localhost:3000/login.html)

Swagger docs: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)

## 🌱 Environment Configuration

The app automatically selects API endpoints for local or production use based on the environment variable APP_ENV.

Development: Uses [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Production: Uses [https://factorymanager-6t60.onrender.com](https://factorymanager-6t60.onrender.com)

Update your .env file or environment variables to toggle between environments.

## 📖 API Documentation (Swagger)

Swagger UI is integrated and available at:

- [Production Swagger](https://factorymanager-6t60.onrender.com/api-docs)
- [Local Swagger](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)

Explore and test all available API endpoints directly from your browser!

## 👤 Test Users

Default Users:

Users can be bootstrapped via the /users endpoint.

For demo/testing, use any user registered in your MongoDB database.

Users are bootstrapped from [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users), use any user with username and email to login.
Each user has 50 actions per day.
